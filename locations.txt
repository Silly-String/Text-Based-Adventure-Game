This study room is completely empty, and you're on the second floor. The staircase is to the east.

START2
You've got an important exam coming up this evening, and you've been studying for weeks. Last night was a particularly
late night on campus. You had difficulty focusing, so rather than staying in one place, you studied in various places
throughout campus as the night progressed. Unfortunately, when you woke up this morning, you were missing some important
exam-related items. You cannot find your T-card, and you're nervous they won't let you into tonight's exam without it.
Also, you seem to have misplaced your lucky exam pen -- even if they let you in, you can't possibly write with another
pen! Finally, your instructor for the course lets you bring a cheat sheet - a handwritten page of information in the
exam. Last night, you painstakingly crammed as much material onto a single page as humanly possible, but that's missing,
too! All of this stuff must be around campus somewhere! Can you find all of it before your exam starts tonight and your
score hits 0?

You are in an empty study room. And by empty, we mean, absolutely empty. All the tables and chairs have been taken out,
the whiteboards taken off the wall, not even the carpeting is left. Are they planning to do something else with this
space? If you walk East you will get to the staircase to the first floor of Robarts.
END2
START3
Huh...I guess there really is nothing to see here. It's all empty...was I even studying here??? Maybe I should stop
wasting time looking around and just...go?

You are on the first floor of the Robarts Library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily
quiet. Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands
near the service desk, looking bored and sleepy. If you walk South you can exit Robarts.
END2
START3
There are some blank papers on the counter over there. Maybe I left my cheat sheet-- nope. Not mine. That guy was just
printing. Whoops. The librarian's been staring at me... Have I been standing here for too long?

You are outside of Mama's best hotdog stand on St. George Street. It's the iconic hotdog stand that everyone knows. The
line for a hotdog is really long. If you head to the East, you can get to the main field, in front of campus. Or maybe
South to McLennan Physical Laboratories? You're math skills *have* been a bit lacking recently...
END2
START3
You're next in line. Hmm...what to order? You still don't have your T-Card, but maybe you could just pay with cash?
Wait a second. What's that on the counter? Is that... your T-Card!! Forget hotdogs! You have an exam to take!!

A girl is sitting along the bench next to you. She's in the same spot you were in while you studied earlier. Maybe
you could ask her to move, so you can check it? She's shaking her head now...is that a no? Fine.
Wait, there's something by her feet. Is that... your lucky pen!
You should maybe go and pick it up now...
Oh! She's picking it up for you, how kind...and she's keeping it.
Yup, that's her pen. She was looking for her pen. Wrong pen...maybe you should go...

Oh, it's AST201! It would be nice to sit and listen for a while. You always wanted to learn a little more about the

That seat, over there, looks comfy. It would make a nice study spot. A guy is sitting there though. Maybe you can
just sit next to him.
Looks like he dropped his pen. Maybe you'll just pick it up for him. If you could just reach...wait a minute...
You know that pen!!
